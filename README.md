### Description

ListViewEditable control allows editing subitems of list view items. It also provides a file searching function. In addition, the property pages provoded allow you to customize various properties such as column headers to suit your needs. I tried to make it useful as possible as I can. I extend thanks to many coders on this site or others because their codes and ideas helped me finish this project.
